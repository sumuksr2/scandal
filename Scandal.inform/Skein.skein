You start off with $1000 and every turn you'll earn a salary of $200.&#x000A;&#x000A;levelTwo&#x000A;It's 5 PM and you just finish a day of hard work. As you leave your warm shop, the fresh bakery smell morphs into the dust and smoke in the dark evening. As you walk home, you sense a strange man at a distance. His tall, shady figure portrays no good news, so you tug your head and keep walking. Moments later, you hear a shriek. You immediately lift your head, only to see the shadow of the strange man pointing a gun at an innocent woman. You can hear his deep voice demanding money and jewelery. As a citizen, you initially feel as if it is your duty to help this woman but then you weigh your options 1) fight the mugger 2) continue walking. If you choose the former, you have a 50% chance of getting mugged and hurt but with the latter you walk home safe and no one gets hurt. What do you chose to do?&#x000A;&#x000A;Cash: 1200&#x000A;Trust: 100&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

You must know me for my numerous speakeasies - No, sorry, excuse me. I mean my businesses around Illinois. Your store seems to be in the optimal position where you get customers from all over the city. However, I see your business seems to be taking a dip recently and I am willing to help you out. Afterall, it would be a shame  if  something were to happen to it. In fact, I'll give you a very good deal. I'll buy your business from you for $1000. SELL your store or IGNORE this letter. But whatever you decide, it's on you!&#x000A; Yours Truly, &#x000A; Mr. Cal Apone&#x000A; (PS.

But more than helping, he loves gambling. He'll only help if you're willing to play a game with him. The game of 21. The game is played with a deck of cards. The aim of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over and to do so you can pick up however many cards from the deck as you seem fit. Once you and Al Capone stop drawing cards from the deck, you'll compare each other's cards and whoever is closest to 21 wins the game. Before the games begin, you'll need to wager in an amount and whoever wins 2 out of the 3 total games walks home with that amount of money. You can choose to bet all of your money or half of it.

When suddenly a man with a large black bag comes into your shop. &#x000A;A few people are looking for me and chasing me and I've been cornered. They're trying to steal my money and stuff in this bag. I will pay you $200 to let me hide this bag here and let me go out through your back storage door. Please I beg you! &#x000A; Although this sounds pretty shady, he is about to pay the amount needed for your daughter's education and it can't hurt to just hide a bag, so it looks like a good deal.

But more than helping, he loves gambling. He'll only help if you're willing to play a game with him. The game of 21. The game is played with a deck of cards. The aim of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over and to do so you can pick up however many cards from the deck as you seem fit. Once you and Al Capone stop drawing cards from the deck, you'll compare each other's cards and whoever is closest to 21 wins the game. Before the games begin, you'll need to wager in an amount and whoever wins 2 out of the 3 total games walks home with that amount of money. You can choose to bet all of your money or half of it. Type play to play the game or leave to get caught by the police and be jailed.&#x000A;&#x000A;Cash: 3200&#x000A;Trust: 100&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

But more than helping, he loves gambling. He'll only help if you're willing to play a game with him. The game of 21. The game is played with a deck of cards. The aim of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over and to do so you can pick up however many cards from the deck as you seem fit. Once you and Al Capone stop drawing cards from the deck, you'll compare each other's cards and whoever is closest to 21 wins the game. Before the games begin, you'll need to wager in an amount and whoever wins 2 out of the 3 total games walks home with that amount of money. You can choose to bet all of your money or half of it. Type play to play the game or leave to get caught by the police and be jailed.&#x000A;&#x000A;Cash: 3200&#x000A;Trust: 100&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

But more than helping, he loves gambling. He'll only help if you're willing to play a game with him. The game of 21. The game is played with a deck of cards. The aim of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over and to do so you can pick up however many cards from the deck as you seem fit. Once you and Al Capone stop drawing cards from the deck, you'll compare each other's cards and whoever is closest to 21 wins the game. Before the games begin, you'll need to wager in an amount and whoever wins 2 out of the 3 total games walks home with that amount of money. You can choose to bet all of your money or half of it. Type play to play the game or leave to get caught by the police and be jailed.&#x000A;&#x000A;Cash: 4000&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

As some of the levels may seem confusing, let me try to explain the main purprose of this game. This was created so you could live the life of an average store owner in the 1920"s USA. With the first case, I wanted to see if you, as the player, would risk your life and money to go help another person who was getting mugged. Usually in the 1920"s since crime was so common, many just ignored it. So if you fought the mugger, good job to you, but just know it was not the norm. Next, you were approached with a series of letters to see if you would give up your shop. If you ignored the letters, depending on your luck, your store had a chance of being burned down and stolen away. This was a common situation during the aforementioned era. Many people faced threats or blackmails by mobs and were sometimes forced to give things away. Then, you were approched by a man who claimed to sell insaurance but this was clearly a case of insaurance fraud. Insaurance and bank frauds were a common issue during the era where many people lost a bunch of money, so I wanted to make sure you're aware of this topic and how it directly affected you as a store owner. Towards the end of the game, you were framed for posessing drugs. A man said he'd pay you to hide a mysterious bag there, but then you were caught for having drugs. On top of that, the police who took you managed to let you free with a deal. This kind of inside crime was a big deal, where police let criminals go due to a bribe or a deal. Finally, you were able to play a fun game with Al Capone and be introduced to his gambling addictions. Although the game is not complete, I hope you were able to get a basic view on how store owners struggled during this era. ***&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT or UNDO the last command?&#x000A;&gt;</result>
